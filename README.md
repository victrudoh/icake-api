# icake-api
Node JS

#Description
This is a cake delivery app i was working on, i added a new endpoint for mail services using NODEMAILER for the ZURI internship task.
I sent an email from the app using nodemailer to myself as directed in the task, i attached a screenshot below.

#NOTE:
use this get request: http://localhost:3030/api/mail?email=victrudoh@gmail.com&firstName=Edikan to test the mail endpoint, change the email and first name as you see fit.
