#Description
This is a cake delivery app i was working on, i added a new endpoint for mail services using NODEMAILER for the ZURI internship.
I sent an email from the app using nodemailer to myself as directed in the task, i attached a screenshot below.

#NOTE
use http://localhost:3030/api/mail?email=victrudoh@gmail.com&firstName=Edikan to test the mail endpoint.
